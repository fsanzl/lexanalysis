***About***

**2.1. poslem.py**

Tokeniser, lemmatiser and PoS-tagger script using the StanfordNLP Python library (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanfordnlp/). This is a frontend for StanfordCoreNLP (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/#about ), therefore, a full installation this toolkit with the Spanish models is required.

*Usage:*

./sposle.py filename
The output will be filename.pole


**2.2. lc.py**

The script to analyse the lemmatised PoS-tagged and calculates some indicators for Lexical Sophistication and Lexical Diversity.
This code is a modified version of LCA (lexical complexity analyzer of  Lu (http://www.personal.psu.edu/xxl13/downloads/lca.html). It just substitutes the BNC corpus for CORPES XXI (Corpus del espa√±ol del siglo XXI) lemmmata frequency list. Some adaptations in the code regarding adverbial morphemes and auxiliary verbs were done. Apart from that, there are some minor syntax corrections to port it to Python 3. HD-D, MTLD and MAAS are calculated with routines of a modified version of Shen Yan Sun's library lexicalrichnes https://github.com/LSYS/lexicalrichness that disables its tokeniser.

*Usage:*

All input files must be POS-tagged and lemmatised with UD tagset in the form lemma_pos. The file should contain a minumum of 50 words. The filename is expected to include the year, month, day, and  number of sample within the day. in the 
form samplename.YYYY.mm.dd.nn[.txt] 

./lc.py filename

It prints to stdout the following comma-sepatrated fields:

samplename,year,month,day,ninday,wordtypes,swordtypes,lextypes,slextypes,wordtokens,swordtokens,lextokens,slextokens,LD,LS1,LS2,VS1,VS2,CVS1,CTTR,RTTR,MAAS,MLTD,HD-D


**3. Example**

./poslem.py quetratadela.2019.12.28.1.txt

./lc.py quetratadela.2019.12.28.1.txt.pole
